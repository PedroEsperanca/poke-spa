Executables
--------

install: `npm install` and then `bower install`

start: `grunt serve`

build: `grunt`

test: `grunt test`

implementation details
--------
The app was initially scaffolded with yeoman, then additional components were developed to achieve the requested functionalities.

In order to reduce server and increase navigation speed data requested is never is never asked for twice, it is properly stored in case it is needed again. (this can be inspected by observing the console)


preprocessors, frameworks and why
--------

- scss: much more organized than regular css

- angular: this framework offers support for all parts of an MVC app

- yeoman: ensure's the app base structure is ready with one command and also offers single commands for easily adding new functionality with multiple files and code updates

- gruntjs: simple task runner


possible ways of improving the application
--------

- writing the requested executables: `bin/setup`, `bin/start`, `bin/test`

- touching up the layouts that are not faithfull to the style guide

- testing: currently the tests available are only those automatically generated by yeoman, a more thorough and corrected testing suit could be implemented

- more consideration into dev, staging and production environments

- removing functionality added by yeoman that isn't needed

- developing mobile layouts
